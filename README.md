# chatti_kathies
This repo contains Denny and Jeremy's Chatti project

####Tuesday, March 8

Jeremy did the pig latin translator function and modified app.js to call to it correctly. He also created a new js file for our call to a a translation API with the first pass at an ajax call within it

Dennis updated the file `app.js` to handle two commands `@weather` and `@joke` and created functions to pull the corresponding API data in two new files `jokes.js` and `weather.js`.

We spent all of Monday and most of Tuesday trouble shooting Vue and CORS issues with little progress  =o.o=

####Wendesday, March 9

Jeremy threw some styling on the page and got the @telephone command working (slowly)

Dennis added CSS styling for message scrolling, converted the weather feature to a new API and added some input error checking

We removed Vue and re-worked `app.js` toegether
