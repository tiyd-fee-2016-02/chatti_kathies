This repo contains Denny and Jeremy's Chatti project

Tuesday, March 8

Jeremy did the pig latin translator function and modified app.js to call to it correctly. He also created a new js file for our call to a a translation API with the first pass at an ajax call within it

Dennis updated the file `app.js` to handle two commands `@weather` and `@joke` and created functions to pull the corresponding API data in two new files `jokes.js` and `weather.js`. He wishes desperately the functions worked =o.o=

Jeremy threw some styling on the page and got the @telephone command working (slowly)
